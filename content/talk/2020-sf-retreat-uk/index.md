The venue and format for this year’s retreat have been chosen to support a small group spending time together in a **beautiful and remote location near London** in **basic accommodation**. 
 
Arrival from Monday August 3rd, departure on Saturday August 8th.    
 
Is this for you?
- Are you familiar with SF.  Do you regard SF to be a fundamental aspect of your work / your life?
- Do you want to reflect upon your own SF practices?
- Do you want to  share  your SF experiences?
- Do you love the beauty and peace of pure nature?
- Would you like to spend five days living and working together? Co-creating enjoyable experiences in nature, food, connecting informally each day on who you are and how you are as a person and in your SF practice
 
**A chance to disconnect from the busyness of every-day  life, retreat to the woods, and spend time with people that share your passion and curiosity for SF.**

**BE AWARE**

- This special place has no wifi nor mobile network
- You’ll be sleeping in shared  dormitories in bunk beds
- We’ll be sharing responsibility for cooking, cleaning, co-creating and running the event together

All of this means that we can offer the event to you for **£280 GBP**.
 
Sadly, this lovely venue can only accommodate **14 people**, so we are sharing this with you now to give you some time to reflect upon this great opportunity. As soon as registrations are open it is "first come, first served”.
 
**Registrations will be open as from Sunday, February 16th at 20h00 CET /  19h00 UK time.**
